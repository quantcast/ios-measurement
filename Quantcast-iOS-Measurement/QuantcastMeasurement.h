 @discussion Start a Quantcast Measurement session. Nothing in the Quantcast Measurement API will work until this method (or beginMeasurementSession:withUserIdentifier:labels:) is called. Must be called first, preferably in the UIApplication delegate's application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: method.  When using this method, do not call beginMesurement, pauseSession, resumeSession, or endMeasurement.  This method is for convience for those application who do not need to send any labels or whose label will remain constant between across all begin, pause, resume and end calls.
 @param inQuantcastAPIKey The Quantcast API key that activity for this app should be reported under. Obtain this key from the Quantcast website.
 @param inUserIdentifierOrNil a user identifier string that is meanigful to the app publisher. This is usually a user login name or anything that identifies the user (different from a device id), but there is no requirement on format of this other than that it is a meaningful user identifier to you. Quantcast will immediately one-way hash this value, thus not recording it in its raw form. You should pass nil to indicate that there is no user identifier available, either at the start of the session or at all.
 @param inLabelsOrNil Either an NSString object or NSArray object containing one or more NSString objects, each of which are a distinct label to be applied to this event. A label is any arbitrary string that you want to be ascociated with this event, and will create a second dimension in Quantcast Measurement reporting. Nominally, this is a "user class" indicator. For example, you might use one of two labels in your app: one for user who ave not purchased an app upgrade, and one for users who have purchased an upgrade.

 @abstract Logs an arbitray event to the Quantcast Measurement SDK.
 @discussion This is the primarily means for logging events with Quantcast Measurement. What gets logged in this method is completely up to the app developper.
 @param inEventName A string that identifies the event being logged. Hierarchical information can be indicated by using a left-to-right notation with a period as a seperator. For example, logging one event named "button.left" and another named "button.right" will create three reportable items in Quantcast App Measurement: "button.left", "button.right", and "button". There is no limit on the cardinality that this hierarchal scheme can create, though low-frequency events may not have an audience report on due to the lack of a statistically significant population.

 @discussion This feature is only useful if you implement a similar (hashed) user identifier recording with Quantcast Measurement on other platforms, such as the web. This method only needs to be called once per session, preferably immediately after the session has begun, or when the user identifier has changed (e.g., the user logged out and a new user logged in). Quantcast will use a one-way hash to encode the user identifier and record the results of that one-way hash, not what is passed here. The method will return the results of that one-way hash for your reference. You do not need to take any action on the results.
 @param inUserIdentifierOrNil a user identifier string that is meanigful to the app publisher. This is usually a user login name or anything that identifies the user (different from a device id), but there is no requirement on format of this other than that it is a meaningful user identifier to you. Quantcast will immediately one-way hash this value, thus not recording it in its raw form. You should pass nil to indicate that a user has logged out.
